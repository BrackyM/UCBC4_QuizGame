In this challenge, we were tasked with a list of acceptance criteria (featured below this section) to create from scratch a Quiz Game.

* Have the user presented with a highscore page and the ability to play the Quiz Game
* The user would be presented with a question with four choices and a timer
* Points are given to a correct answer and points are not added or removed for a wrong answer as well as a loss of time (in seconds)
* The quiz would give the user a score at the end where they could save their name with the score to the highscores page that is viewable

This project wasn't given starter code.


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a quiz game that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s request:

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```

## Contributions


I followed a tutorial to help get it generally running. I styled it differently and the logic helped me learn and get through the construction. However, it wasn't working and I did a lot of my own changes and customizations on top of my customizations during the tutorial.
